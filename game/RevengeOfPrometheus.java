/**
 * This is an old school text based adventure game called Revenge of Prometheus. The program is mainly based on object-oriented programming
 * concepts; abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and object manipulations. Iteration algorithms and a little math is used throughout
 * the program. The story is an alternative scenario for the Greek Mythology character Prometheus. 
 * The entire program took 3 days to design and write by myself. 
 * See the method explanations for better understanding as well as the other class descriptions.
 * throws InterruptedException statements are for adding a sleep time between the sentences being displayed on the screen.
